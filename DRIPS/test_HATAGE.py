I'd be happy to help you write code! However, your prompt "Video" is quite vague. 

Could you provide more details about what you'd like to do? For example:


- **Video processing**: Convert, resize, or edit video files?
- **Video player**: Create a simple video playback application?
- **Video downloading**: Download videos from a URL?
- **Video analysis**: Extract frames or analyze video content?
- **Something else**: Other video-related functionality?

Please clarify w

hat you need, and I'll generate the appropriate code for your test file.
